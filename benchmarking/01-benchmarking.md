# Here we go about Benchmarking


## Questions
- What are the tools to profile code in Python?
- How they are working? (Technically, and theoretically)
- What information do they offer? (What are metrics?)
- What are the actual metrics that we are curious about? What and why.
- What are the best practices of the profiling?
- What is the best profiler that is good for webservices? Why?


## Practice


### Get yourself a code to profile
There is a chance you have been faced with a code that seemed not really
performant. Or, your lead may have talked about an API that is slow.
Take this API, and run a profiler on it.

- Talk about the process you went through.
- What is the cause to this slowness?
- Provide a theoretical solution (do not implement a solution, just talk)
